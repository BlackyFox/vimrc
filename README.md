# vimrc

This repository is an example of configuration for [Vim](http://www.vim.org/ "Vim, the editor").

## Automated install
Oh I see! You want to be as lazy as it can be? Fine, I understand you.
Just copy and paste this line and you'll have something good ;)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlackyFox/vimrc && ./vimrc/setup.sh
```

## Manual installation
Manual installation is really simple. You just have to copy the ```.vim``` folder and the ```.vimrc``` file inside your home directory to set it up!
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlackyFox/vimrc
cd vimrc
cp .vim* $HOME/ -R
```

## Credits

Huge thanks to him for his work!
